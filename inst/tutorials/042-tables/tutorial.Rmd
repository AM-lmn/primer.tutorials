<!-- Make a new tutorial which is "tables": https://ppbds.github.io/primer/tools.html#how-to-make-a-table. https://gt.rstudio.com/. First section should show how to make tables with knitr::kable(). Do it like distill package. Pull out table questions from distill and put them here. (You need to clean up distill, renumber exercises and so on. The Tables and Images section becomes just Images.) Make sure you have students do something to prove that they have followed the steps. Last section should be a brand new, start from scratch repo all the way to R pubs which makes a nice table. Take a look at RStudio and Friends tutorial. Interesting: -->


<!-- Pick another package (beyond kable and gt) which specializes in interactive tables. Create a Section which uses it. Maybe https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/.  Done.-->

<!-- Add a gtsummary section. Inspiration: https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2021-07-14-polished-summary-tables-in-r-with-gtsummary/ -->

<!-- kableExtra seems like a good package to cover, it adds a lot more customization options. Yes! Do we have time? -->

<!-- Should I add a section about creating a theme? There are no themes built-in to gt. Themes are cool! Do we have time? -->


## kable
### 

The **knitr** package "provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R using [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) techniques."  `kable()` is a function in **knitr** for [making tables](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

By the end of this section you will create a table that looks like this:

```{r}
kable_t <- nominate %>% 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select(name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"),
        align = "l", 
        caption = "Sample of Nominate Data of Senate Members from the First Congress")

kable_t
```

### Exercise 1

Load the **knitr** library.

```{r kable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

### 

### Exercise 2

We will use the data in `nominate` in this section. Run `glimpse()` on `nominate` to learn about the variables.

```{r kable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(nominate) 
```

### 

`nominate` is a data set that provides information on Congressional roll call votes in the United States from the first U.S. Congress in 1789 to the `r max(nominate$congress)`th Congress.

### Exercise 3

Continue the pipe with `arrange()` to sort the data set alphabetically by `name`

```{r kable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

`nominate` includes votes from the Senate, the President of the United States, and the House of Representatives.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe and `filter()` the data to show only observations where `congress == 1`, `party == "Anti-Administration"`and `chamber == "Senate"`.

```{r kable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
filter(congress == ..., chamber = "...")
```

### 

`nominate` includes indicators of politicians' ideological positions, which have been estimated using \href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)", NOMINATE

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `name`, `born`, `died`, `state`, `nominate_dim1`, `nominate_dim2` columns.

```{r kable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(...)
```

### 

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `kable()` to create a table.

```{r kable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable()
```

### 

The output should look like this:

```{r}
nominate %>% 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select( name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `kable()`, change the column names to match those in the table we are trying to create using the `col.names()` argument. The argument within `col.names` should be a list (`c()`) which includes each column name going from left to right.

<!-- Make this question more clear -->

```{r kable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"))
```

### Exercise 8

Add another argument to `kable()` that assigns "l" to `align`. This will left-align the data.

```{r kable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(...,
        align = "l")
```

### 

You can assign "c" or "r" to `align` if you want to center-align or right-align the data.

### 

You can individually align specific columns using a list

### 

Your table should now be identical to the one we are aiming to make. Good job!

```{r}
kable_t
```

### 

Note that we are unable to create a good title, cite our source, or easily customize our table even further.

You can create a caption by assigning a string to the caption variable within `kable()`

While kable allows the creation of tables, customization of tables is limited when using this package. Instead we can use a different package that better suits our needs.



## gt
### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Dragon-Ball-GT.jpeg")
```

It is time to learn about **gt**

### 

Nope not Dragon Ball GT.

### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Ford-GT.jpeg")
```

### 

Not the Ford GT either. 

### 

The **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** we will learn about is even better than those other ones. Using **gt** you will be able to create better tables. 

### Exercise 1

Load the **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** library.

```{r gt-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be [used](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/) to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/) this package. 


### Exercise 2

Run `?gt` on the next line to get more information about the `gt( )` function. This will give you an idea of what you need to make best use of this function.

```{r gt-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?gt
```

### 

Some other packages we can use to create tables are **gt**, **reactable**, **DT**, **formattable**, and **flextable**.

### 

Now let's make a table! the table we will make will end up looking like this:

```{r}
gt_t <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Observations of Enos Data Sample**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
    tab_source_note("Enos (2014)") %>%
    fmt_currency(columns = c(income), 
                 decimals = 0) 
gt_t
```

### 

The data set that will be used to make this table is the `trains` data set which can be found in **primer.data**.

### Exercise 3

Print the `trains` data set


```{r gt-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains
```

### 

This shows us the first 10 rows of the data set. At this point we do not know what any of the data means.

### Exercise 4

Look up the help page with `?trains`.

```{r gt-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains
```

### 

`?trains` isn't the only way to get more information about a data set. Some other functions are `glimpse(trains)`,  `summary(trains)`, `skim(trains)`, and `View(trains)`. 

### Exercise 5

Start a pipe with the `trains` data set. `select()` the `gender`, `income`, and `att_end` columns.

```{r gt-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

`trains` is a data set that shows individuals' attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after an experiment which randomly exposed a treated group to Spanish-speakers on a Boston commuter train platform.

### Exercise 6

Add `slice()` to the pipe so that only the first 5 rows are displayed

```{r gt-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  slice(...:...)
```

### 

### Exercise 7

Continue your pipe with `gt()`.

```{r gt-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

Your output should look like this:

```{r}
trains %>% 
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

We now have a functional table. Let's make it look like the table we are aiming to make.

A reminder on how that table looks:

```{r}
gt_t
```

### Exercise 8

Add a `title` and `subtitle` to the table by using `tab_header()`.
```{r gt-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "...",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:
```{r}
trains %>%
    select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
slice(1:5) %>% 
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Enos Data Observations", 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

### 

Notice how the title is not bold like it is in the table we want to recreate.

### Exercise 9

By default, titles and other text can not be formatted. To format them, wrap the character string in a call to md().

```{r gt-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**...**"),
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Change the column names using cols_label()
```{r gt-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(... = "...",
             ... = "...",
             ... = "...")
```

### Exercise 11

Add a caption/cite your source using tab_source_note()

```{r gt-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note("...")
```

### Exercise 12

Part of the caption should be italicized. This can be done by wrapping the character string in a call to md()

```{r gt-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("..., *...*"))
```

### Exercise 13

Add dollar signs and commas to the income column using fmt_currency() (if you only want commas, you can use fmt_number()). Put income within c() to indicate that income is a currency, and assign a value of 0 to the decimals argument. Make sure that your table looks like the table we are aiming to make.

```{r gt-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  fmt_currency(c(...), decimals = ...)
```

Remember, your final table should look like

```{r}
gt_t
```

## nhanes
### 

Let's make a new table using a different data set to make sure we understand how to effectively use `gt`

### 

The table we will be making will look like this:

<!-- Make cooler! attention grabbing maybe incorporate palatteer?-->

```{r}
nhanes_t <- nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age > 40, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Relationship between Household Income, Sleep and General Health in Mexican Women who are over 40 years old**"),
             subtitle = "Those who make over 75,000 seem to have the best General Health") %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = "Household Income",
             age = "Age",
             sleep = "Sleep (in hours)",
             general_health = "General Health") %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011*")) %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "General Health is ranked on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is \"poor\" health, 2 is \"fair\", 3 is \"good\", 4 is \"very good\", and 5 is \"excellent\".", locations = cells_body(column = general_health))
nhanes_t
```

### Exercise 1

Run `nhanes` to load in the data set.

```{r nhanes-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes
```

### 

We don't know what any of this data is yet.

### Exercise 2

Run `?nhanes` data set to get more information about it.

```{r nhanes-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?nhanes
```

### 

From this we learn that `nhanes` contains data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) research survey. The survey examines health and nutritional status nationwide.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with `nhanes`. Continue the pipe to `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `year` is `2011`, `gender` is `"Female"`, `age` is greater than `40`, and `race` is `"Mexican"`.

```{r nhanes-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == ..., gender == "...", age > ..., race == "...")
```

### 

These restrictions were chosen arbitrarily so that our end table is of manageable size.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with `drop_na()` to drop all the rows with any missing values

```{r nhanes-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  drop_na()
```

### 

`nhanes` is a unique data set as the surveyors conducts both interviews and physical examination to produce their data.

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health` columns.

```{r nhanes-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ..., ...)
```

### 

The survey is run by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `age`.

```{r nhanes-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `hh_income`

```{r nhanes-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

The reason why we arranged the data twice is so that the second column is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age > 40, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income)
```

### Exercise 8

Continue the pipe with `gt()`

```{r nhanes-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

This created a basic table from our manipulated data



### Exercise 9

add a `title` and `subtitle` using the `tab_header()` function. Remember that to bold the title you need to use the `md()` function

```{r nhanes-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "**...**",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Continue the pipe to add labels for the columns. Use `col_label()` and change the labels for `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health`. 

```{r nhanes-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = ...,
             age = ...,
             sleep = ...,
             general_health = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

Continue the pipe to add a footnote (using `tab_footnote()`) which will indicate how `general_health` is ranked. assign the footnote to the `footnote` parameter, and assign the `cells_body()` function to location. Within `cells_body()` set the column to `general_health`. This adds the footnote to all the values within `general_health`.

```{r nhanes-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
To make quotation marks appear, add a "\" before the "
```

```{r nhanes-11-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "...",
               locations = cells_body(column = ...))
```

### 

The information added to the footnote was given when `?nhanes` was run



### Exercise 12

Continue the pipe to include the source of the data. use `tab_source_note()` and use  `md()` to italicize the source information.

```{r nhanes-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to italicize text using md() is adding `*` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*...*"))
```

### 

Congratulations, you should now have created a table that looks like this:

```{r}
nhanes_t
```

## regression tables
**gtsummary** is a package that can be used to summarize data and tibbles and is useful in creating regression tables. A regression table shows how closely the relationship between independent variable(s) and a dependent variable is.

### Exercise 1

Learn more about the **gtsummary** package by running `?gtsummary`

```{r regression-tables-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?gtsummary
```

### 

**gtsummary** creates presentation-ready tables.

### Exercise 2

We will also need the **rstanarm** package to create a regression table. It allows for the estimation of models. run `?rstanarm` to learn more about the package.

```{r regression-tables-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?rstanarm
```

### 

**rstanarm** uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a programming language, for its estimation. This is done through the **rstan** package.

### Exercise 3

load in the **gtsummary** and **rstanarm** packages.

```{r regression-tables-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### 

Let's create a regression table that looks like:

```{r}
fit2 <- stan_glm(data = trains, formula = att_end ~ party, refresh = 0)

regression1_t <- tbl_regression(fit2, 
               intercept = TRUE, 
               estimate_fun = function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2)) %>%
  as_gt() 

regression2_t <- regression1_t %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
             subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
regression2_t

```

### Exercise 4

Use the `stan_glm()` function. Within `stan_glm()` assign `att_end ~ party` to `formula`, `trains` to `data`, and `0` to `refresh`. Assign this code to an object called `m1`

```{r regression-tables-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
m1 <- stan_glm(...)
```

### 

the `stan_glm` function estimates [Generalized Linear Models (GLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model).

### Exercise 5

Copy your code from the last exercise. On a new line start a pipe with the `tbl_regression()` function. Within `tbl_regression()` assign `m1` to `x`, `TRUE` to `intercept`, and `function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2))` to `estimate_fun`.

```{r regression-tables-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
tbl_regression(...)
```

### 

`estimate_fun` allows us to round and format the coefficient estimates provided by `tbl_regression()`

### 

The `function()` function allows us to define new functions.

The `style_sigfig()` function converts a numeric argument to a string that has been rounded to a significant figure-like number.

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `as_gt()`.

```{r regression-tables-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  as_gt()
```

### 

Currently you should have a simple table that looks like this:

```{r}
regression1_t
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe with `tab_header()` to add a suitable title and subtitle. 

```{r regression-tables-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  tab_header(...)
```

### Exercise 8

Continue the pipe to add a caption using `tab_source_note`. To properly format the caption, wrap the character string in a call to md(). 

```{r regression-tables-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string 
```

```{r regression-tables-8-hint-2, eval = FALSE}

### 

Congrats! You should now have a completed table that looks like:

```{r}
regression2_t
```

## reactable
### 

**[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** is a package that allows us to create interactive tables.

### Exercise 1

Load the **[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** library.

```{r reactable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r reactable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be used to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/) this package. 


### Exercise 2

Run `?reactable` on the next line to get more information about the `reactable()` function. This will give you an idea of what you need to make best use of this function.

```{r reactable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r reactable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?reactable
```

### Exercise 3

Run `reactable(trains)` to create a very simple table using the data found within the `trains` data set.

```{r reactable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
reactable(trains)
```

### 

Now, let's create a table that looks like this. 

```{r}
# paletteer_c("ggthemes::Red-Blue-White Diverging", 13)

reactable1_t <- trains %>%
  filter(treatment ==  "Control") %>%
  filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age >= 40) %>% 
  select(gender, age, race, party, att_start, att_end, ideology_start, ideology_end) %>%
  reactable(
    pagination = FALSE,
    highlight = TRUE,
    compact = TRUE,
    outlined = TRUE,
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "left"),
    columns = list(
    gender = colDef( name = "Gender"),
    age = colDef(name = "Age"),
    race = colDef(name = "Race"),
    party = colDef(name = "Party"),
    att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"),
    att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"),
    ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology"),
    ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology"))
    )
reactable2_t <- trains %>%
  filter(treatment ==  "Treated") %>%
  filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age >= 40) %>% 
  select(gender, age, race, party, att_start, att_end, ideology_start, ideology_end) %>%
  reactable(
    pagination = FALSE,
    highlight = TRUE,
    compact = TRUE,
    outlined = TRUE,
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      align = "left"),
    columns = list(
    gender = colDef( name = "Gender"),
    age = colDef(name = "Age"),
    race = colDef(name = "Race"),
    party = colDef(name = "Party"),
    att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"),
    att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"),
    ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology"),
    ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology"))
    )
reactable1_t
reactable2_t
```

### 

Note that you can interact with this table!

### Exercise 4

To create this table, we will use the trains data set. run `?trains` to learn more about the data set

```{r reactable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains 
```

### 

Note that there are 2 levels in `treatment`. We will create 2 different tables highlighting the levels to allow easier comparision.

### Exercise 5

Start a pipe with `trains`. Continue the pipe and `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `treatment == "Control"`, `gender == "Female"`, and `age >= 40`.

```{r reactable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  filter(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

We will later work with the rows where the group is treated.

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe to `select()` the `gender`, `age`, `race`, `party`, `att_start`, `att_end`, `ideology_start`, and `ideology_end` columns.


```{r reactable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  select(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe with `reactable()` to create a simple table.

```{r reactable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable()
```

### Exercise 8

Within `reactable()` assign `FALSE` to `pagination`. This makes the table to display on one page.

```{r reactable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(pagination = ...)
```

### 

This is useful when your table only takes a few pages to display.

### Exercise 9

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `highlight`. This will highlight table rows on hover.

```{r reactable-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., highlight = ...)
```

### 

Another method to make rows more distinguishable is by assigning `TRUE` to `striped` within `reactable()`. This will change the background of every other row.

### Exercise 10

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `compact`. This makes the table more compact.

```{r reactable-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., compact = ...)
```

### 

This is a good parameter to use if you want a minimalist table.

### Exercise 11

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `outlined`. This will add borders around the table.

```{r reactable-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., outlined = ...)
```

### Exercise 12

`defaultColDef` is a parameter within `reactable()` that allows us to define the default settings for each column within our table.

Within `reactable()`, assign `colDef(align = "left")` to `defaultColDef`. This will left-align all columns.


```{r reactable-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., defaultColDef = colDef(align = "left"))
```

### 

`colDef()` is a function that allows us to define what a column will look like in the table.

### Exercise 13

within`reactable()` assign  `gender = colDef( name = "Gender"), age = colDef(name = "Age"), race = colDef(name = "Race"), party = colDef(name = "Party"), att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"), att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"), ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology"), ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology")` within a `list()` to `columns`.

This will rename the columns to more suitable names.

<!-- AJ: Should I split this up so that it is easier to read? -->

```{r reactable-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., columns = list(...))
```

### Exercise 14

Now assign that table to an object called `reactable1_t`.

```{r reactable-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
reactable1_t <- ...
```

### 

Now let's work on the second table that displays information on the individuals who were treated.

### Exercise 15

Copy your code for `reactable1_t`. Change `"Control"` to `"Treated"` in line 2.

```{r reactable-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>%
  filter(treatment ==  "Treated", ...) %>% 
  ...
```

### Exercise 16

Now assign that table to an object called `reactable2_t`.

```{r reactable-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
reactable2_t <- ...
```

### Exercise 17

<!-- AJ: IDK how I can put them side by side without using kable. Is there a way to do this through HTML? -->

print a `list()` that contains `reactable1_t` and `reactable2_t`. This should display them side by side.

```{r reactable-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

Congratulations!

You should have now created a table that looks like:

```{r}
reactable1_t 
reactable2_t
```

```{r download-answers, child = "../../child_documents/download_answers.Rmd"}
```
